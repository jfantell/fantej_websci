Notes:

I decided to display the tweet text in one carousel and twitter names in another. I was going for hashtags but not enough of the tweets had hashtags (or I was doing something wrong...always a possibility). 

BTW: The first tweet displayed does not display a profile picture (of course not). However, it is not that the profile url does not exist. The url does exist but for some reason there is no image at that location. So that's Twitter's fault, not mine.
