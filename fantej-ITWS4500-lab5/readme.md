Although the lab was challenging from the standpoint that this is the first time I used a streaming api and sockets, I feel that I learned a lot from it. The use of sockets and apis is going to play a major part in my group's term project so learning the groundwork of Node, Express, and Angular now is a big plus.

YouTube video explained how to build a chat application from scratch with sockets. I used that as the basis of building the Twitter feed app.
